 <p>We can optimize a soution using both time and space optimization. To optimize a program,</p>

	<ol>
		<li>We can reduce the time taken to run the program and increase the space occupied</li>

		<li>We can reduce the memory usage of the program and increase it's total run time</li>

		<li>We can reduse both time and space complexity by deploying relevent algorithms</li>
